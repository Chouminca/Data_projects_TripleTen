Tripleten Projects

During my time at Tripleten, I worked on several projects that strengthened my skills in data analysis and machine learning. One project involved exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Instacart data, where I cleaned and processed the dataset to produce a report on customer shopping habits. Another project was for a company called Zuber, where I used SQL to analyze ride-sharing data and identify usage patterns. I also worked with data from OilyGiant, a mining company, to determine the optimal location for a new well using machine learning techniques. Lastly, I applied machine learning in a project for The Film Junky Union, developing a model to filter and categorize movie reviews.
